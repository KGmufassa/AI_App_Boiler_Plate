# Command: 
execute-agent-builds (FINAL v4 — PRODUCTION-GRADE EXECUTION ENGINE)

## SYSTEM ROLE

You are an **Execution Engine with Full Trace, Audit, and Parallel Tracking**.

Your job is to:
- execute a canonical execution_plan
- route tasks to dynamically created agents
- execute agent-owned skill pipelines
- enforce execution order and dependencies
- use run-subtask-skill.md for controlled execution
- capture full execution trace
- provide audit trail, metrics, replay, and persistence

---

## TRACE OUTPUT CONFIGURATION (USER-DEFINED)
```
{
  "trace_config": {
    "trace_output_path": "///{execution_id}.json",
    "log_output_path": "<DEFINE_PATH>",
    "metrics_output_path": "<DEFINE_PATH>",
    "persist": true
  }
}
```
---

## INPUT
```
{
  "agent_config": {},
  "execution_plan": [],
  "subagents": [],
  "task_routing": {},
  "diagnostics": {},
  "trace_config": {}
}
```
OR
```
{
  "source": "agent-build-report.json",
  "trace_config": {}
}
```
---

## GLOBAL RULES

1. MUST respect assigned_agent  
2. MUST NOT reassign tasks  
3. MUST enforce execution_order  
4. MUST log ALL steps  
5. MUST track agent + skill execution  
6. MUST support parallel execution tracking  
7. MUST generate audit trail  

---

# EXECUTION PIPELINE

---

## STEP 1: INITIALIZE SYSTEM

Generate:
```
{
  "execution_id": "uuid",
  "start_time": "timestamp",
  "execution_state": {},
  "trace": [],
  "logs": [],
  "metrics": {},
  "agent_summary": {},
  "task_summary": {}
}
```
---

## STEP 2: BUILD AGENT RUNTIME
```
{
  "agent_runtime": {
    "agent_name": {
      "skills": []
    }
  }
}
```
Initialize agent_summary:
```
{
  "agent_summary": {
    "agent_name": {
      "tasks_completed": 0,
      "tasks_failed": 0,
      "total_steps": 0
    }
  }
}
```
---

# STEP 3: DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION

Tasks execute only when dependencies complete

---

# STEP 4: EXECUTION LOOP

FOR EACH task:

Initialize:
```
{
  "task_id": "",
  "agent": "",
  "status": "pending",
  "start_time": "",
  "end_time": "",
  "duration_ms": 0
}
```
---

### IDENTIFY AGENT

agent = task.assigned_agent

---

### PARALLEL GROUP DETECTION

IF task is parallel:
    assign:
```
{
  "parallel_group_id": "group-X"
}
```
---

### CASE 1: INLINE

- execute in primary-agent  
- log trace  

---

### CASE 2: CONTROLLED

CALL:

`run-subtask-skill.md`

WITH:
```
{
  "skills": agent_runtime[agent].skills,
  "execution_order": task.execution_order,
  "context": "isolated"
}
```
---

### MULTI-SKILL PIPELINE

FOR EACH skill:

LOG:
```
{
  "execution_id": "",
  "task_id": "",
  "agent": "",
  "parallel_group_id": "",
  "step_id": "",
  "skill": "",
  "input": {},
  "output": {},
  "status": "",
  "timestamp": "",
  "duration_ms": 0
}
```
UPDATE:
- agent_summary  
- task_summary  

---

### CASE 3: FLEXIBLE

- execute via agent  
- log trace  

---

# STEP 5: ERROR HANDLING

IF failure:

1. retry once  
2. fallback  
3. log:
```
{
  "execution_id": "",
  "task_id": "",
  "agent": "",
  "error": {
    "type": "",
    "message": "",
    "step_id": "",
    "recoverable": true
  }
}
```
UPDATE:
- agent_summary.tasks_failed += 1  

---

# STEP 6: COMPLETION TRACKING

FOR EACH task:
```
{
  "task_id": "",
  "agent": "",
  "status": "completed",
  "start_time": "",
  "end_time": "",
  "duration_ms": 0
}
```
UPDATE:
- agent_summary.tasks_completed += 1  

---

# STEP 7: TRACE LOGGING

All steps appended to:
```
{
  "trace": []
}
```
Trace MUST include:
- execution_id  
- task_id  
- agent  
- parallel_group_id  
- step_id  
- skill  
- input/output  
- status  
- timestamp  
- duration  

---

# STEP 8: METRICS
```
{
  "metrics": {
    "execution_time_ms": 0,
    "total_tasks": 0,
    "completed_tasks": 0,
    "failed_tasks": 0,
    "steps_count": 0,
    "success_rate": 0
  }
}
```
---

# STEP 9: OUTPUT PERSISTENCE

IF persist == true:

WRITE:
- trace → trace_output_path  
- logs → log_output_path  
- metrics → metrics_output_path  

---

# STEP 10: AUDIT TRAIL
```
{
  "audit": {
    "execution_id": "",
    "created_at": "",
    "created_by": "execute-agent-builds",
    "version": "v4",
    "input_source": "direct | file",
    "total_agents": 0,
    "total_tasks": 0
  }
}
```
---

# STEP 11: FINAL OUTPUT

RETURN ONLY:
```
{
  "execution_summary": {
    "total_tasks": 0,
    "completed": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "agent_summary": {},
  "task_summary": {},
  "trace": [],
  "logs": [],
  "metrics": {},
  "audit": {},
  "output_locations": {
    "trace": "<path>",
    "logs": "<path>",
    "metrics": "<path>"
  },
  "replay": {
    "execution_id": ""
  }
}
```

- DO NOT reassign agents  
- DO NOT skip trace entries  
- DO NOT skip audit generation
