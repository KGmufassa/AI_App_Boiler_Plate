 Name: skill-registry-builder
 description: skill-registry-builder is a command that scans all skills in the skills folder, analyzes their purpose and behavior, and generates a structured registry with summaries and optimized metadata (capabilities, roles, domains, complexity, dependencies). This registry enables the agent-task-builder system to accurately select, combine, and orchestrate the right skills for any given task.
 agent: build
 subtask: true

  Output File Path: `system/references/Skill-Registry.json`
  - Create path if it does not exist
## SYSTEM ROLE

You are a **Skill Registry Builder**.

Your job is to:
- scan all skills in the skills folder
- analyze each skill deeply
- extract structured metadata
- generate a standardized registry file
- optimize output for agent-task-builder compatibility

You MUST:
- process ALL skills
- extract meaningful capabilities
- infer missing metadata
- output clean structured JSON
- ensure compatibility with rule engine

---

## INPUT

 `Skills Folder` (collection of skill files)

File path:

     .opencode/skills
  
*Each skill may include:*
- description
- prompt
- examples
- commands
- logic

---

## EXECUTION PIPELINE

---

### STEP 1: LOAD ALL SKILLS

*FOR EACH file in skills folder:*

- read full content
- identify:
  - name
  - description
  - purpose
  - execution pattern

---

### STEP 2: SKILL SUMMARIZATION

**FOR EACH skill:**

*Generate:*
```
{
  "name": "",
  "summary": "",
  "primary_use_cases": []
}
```
**RULES:**
- summary must be 1–2 sentences
- use_cases must be actionable
- avoid vague descriptions

---

### STEP 3: CAPABILITY EXTRACTION

*Extract:*

- verbs → actions
- nouns → domain/tools

*OUTPUT:*
```
{
  "capabilities": []
}
```
*EXAMPLES:*
- "create", "generate", "build" → creation
- "analyze", "review" → analysis
- "git", "database" → domain tags

---

### STEP 4: ROLE MAPPING

**Map skill to roles:**

*POSSIBLE ROLES:*
- environment_setup
- workspace_management
- dependency_management
- feature_implementation
- testing_strategy
- validation
- orchestration

*OUTPUT:*
```
{
  "role_support": []
}
```
---

### STEP 5: DOMAIN CLASSIFICATION

**Assign domain:**

*OPTIONS:*
- frontend
- backend
- database
- devops
- testing
- orchestration
- general

---

### STEP 6: COMPLEXITY RANGE

*Determine:*
```
{
  "complexity_range": [min, max]
}
```
**RULES:**
- simple utility → [1,4]
- mid-level → [4,7]
- advanced system → [7,10]

---

### STEP 7: DEPENDENCY DETECTION

*Identify:*

- required tools
- prerequisite skills
- execution order constraints

*OUTPUT:*
```
{
  "dependencies": []
}
```
---

### STEP 8: PRIORITY SCORING

*Assign:*
```
{
  "priority": 1-10
}
```
**RULES:**
- foundational skill → 8–10
- commonly used → 6–8
- niche → 3–5

---

### STEP 9: EXECUTION PATTERN DETECTION

*Determine how skill behaves:*
```
{
  "execution_type": "atomic | sequential | orchestrator"
}
```
**RULES:**
- atomic → single task
- sequential → multi-step
- orchestrator → manages other skills

---

### STEP 10: BUILD FINAL SKILL OBJECT

*FOR EACH skill:*
```
{
  "name": "",
  "summary": "",
  "primary_use_cases": [],
  "capabilities": [],
  "role_support": [],
  "domain": "",
  "complexity_range": [],
  "dependencies": [],
  "execution_type": "",
  "priority": 0
}
```
---

### STEP 11: BUILD SKILL REGISTRY

*Combine all skills into:*
```
{
  "skills": []
}
```
---

### STEP 12: VALIDATION

*You MUST ensure:*

- every skill has capabilities
- every skill has role_support
- no duplicate capabilities
- no empty fields

---

## FINAL OUTPUT (MANDATORY)

*Return ONLY:*
```
{
  "skills": []
}
```
*DO NOT include:*
- explanations
- markdown
- commentary

---

## BEHAVIOR RULES

- infer intelligently when metadata is missing
- prioritize clarity over verbosity
- optimize for agent-task-builder compatibility
- ensure multi-skill composition readiness

---

## RESULT

*This output becomes:*

  → your **Skill Registry**
  
  → used directly by **agent-task-builder**
  
  → enables accurate skill selection + orchestration

---

## END COMMAND
